# Teamspeak-Bot-ShoutCast-Music
Teamspeak3 Query Bot ShoutCast Stream bot broadcast music name
This program made in java, can send messages to the channel and tell what music is playing @ shoutcast stream.

To edit this OpenSource program you need to have a Teamspeak 3 API:
https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API

Thats the best Java API that i found for Teamspeak3.
Contribute for this program.
TeamSpeak that you can see the bot in action: ts.htlv-team.com

Know bugs:
  * FIXED * - Sends 2 messages to a user that enter's on teamseak server. * FIXED *
 - If some music bot is playing on a Teamspeak3 server the bot probably will send the next music 10 sec before the music change, that happens because the music bots are always delayed.

What you can do:
 - You can change the Bot Prefix and Nickname to whatever you want.
 - You can and you must edit something to make the bot better, by forking with.

What you can't do:
 - You can't sell this program and say that you made it alone.
 - You can't make profit with this program!
